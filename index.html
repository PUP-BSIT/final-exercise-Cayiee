        <p class="input">Dear Future Self,<br><br>
            As I reflect on my journey as a BSIT student, I envision a future 
            where I stand at the crossroads of being a seasoned IT professional
            and a thriving business owner. The dream to immerse myself in the 
            dynamic IT industry while steering the ship of my own business 
            venture is challenging yet deeply exciting. Balancing these dual 
            roles demands resilience, but it is a vision that fuels my 
            passion.<br><br>The industry glimpse you showed me, marked by late 
            nights grappling with code and the weight of expectations, revealed
            the intensity of this path. However, within these challenges, 
            I discovered a profound sense of purpose. The desire to pursue both
            IT professionalism and entrepreneurship is not a passing whim; it 
            is a committed journey aligned with my deepest passions.<br><br>Is
            it worth it? Undoubtedly. The struggles are not barriers but the
            crucible where skills are honed and resilience is forged. Whether 
            facing challenges or celebrating triumphs, the unwavering 
            commitment to continue persists because this is what I want. 
            Despite the toughness of the past months and the potential hurdles 
            in the coming weeks, I want to affirm that I am here because this 
            path resonates with my aspirations.<br><br>The challenges are not 
            deterring; they are propelling me forward. The intricacies of the 
            IT field and entrepreneurship may be demanding, but they are 
            precisely what I desire. This path resonates with my aspirations 
            and fuels the passion propelling me forward. Here's to the next 
            five yearsâ€”a journey of growth, learning, and the realization of a 
            dream that is unequivocally worth every struggle.</p>
